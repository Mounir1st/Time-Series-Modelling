# MS4S09 – Time Series Modelling Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for the module **MS4S09: Data Mining and Statistical Modelling.

The aim of this project is to apply time series analysis techniques in **R** to real-world ambulance service data, focusing on both demand and performance within a healthcare context.

## Project Overview

I analyse two datasets provided as part of the assessment:
- Monthly non-emergency ambulance call volumes
- Monthly emergency ambulance response times

The coursework is split into two sections:
- **Section A**: Time series modelling and statistical analysis
- **Section B**: Professional, non-technical reporting of findings for a healthcare audience

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains the raw datasets used in the analysis.

- `scripts/`  
  Contains R scripts used to perform all analysis for both Section A and Section B.

- `outputs/` (optional)  
  Contains selected plots and figures used in the final report.

## Methods Used

The analysis includes:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Identification of trend and seasonality
- Time series decomposition
- Stationarity assessment
- Time series model identification and diagnostic checking
- Professional interpretation of results in a healthcare context


## Notes

- All analysis was completed using R.
- The `tseries` package was not used, in accordance with assessment restrictions.
- This repository is intended for academic coursework purposes only.
