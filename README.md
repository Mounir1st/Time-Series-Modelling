# Time-Series-Modelling
Time series analysis coursework for Data Mining and Statistical Modelling, focusing on exploratory analysis and modelling of ambulance service demand data using R.

The project applies time series analysis techniques in R to ambulance service data, including:
- Monthly non-emergency ambulance call volumes
- Monthly emergency ambulance response times

## Structure
- `data/` – Raw datasets provided for the assessment
- `scripts/` – R scripts for Section A (time series modelling) and Section B (professional analysis)
- `outputs/` – Key plots used in the final report (if applicable)

## Methods
The analysis includes:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Trend and seasonality assessment
- Time series decomposition
- Stationarity checks
- Time series model identification and diagnostics

All code is fully reproducible and aligns with the assessment requirements.
